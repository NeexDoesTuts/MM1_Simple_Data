## Expressions in BSL (Beginning Student Language) 

When we want to compute the average of 4, 6.2 and -12, all three of the following expressions evaluate to the correct result. Which expression do you think is the best, and why?

```
(/ (+ 4 6.2 -12) 3)		 				- 83.5%
(/ (+ -8 6.2) 3) 		 				- 3.6% 
-0.6					 				- 3.7%
Doesn't matter, all are equally good.	- 9.2%
```

My answer:  I think that it is best to keep all the given numbers and not make any "hidden calculations". Assuming these numbers have some meaning, it would be much easier in the future to understand this expression than the other two.

Prof: This answer most clearly expresses that 3 numbers are being averaged - first summed, then divided by 3. 

Both rounds had the same percent!
